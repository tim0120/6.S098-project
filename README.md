# 6.S098-project

Course Project for 6.S098 class taught by Theo Diamandis

Ideas:
- Real class data
  - Just using MIT data itself
  - Robust approach 1: Take class data (i.e., rating, number of ratings) and randomly sample to simulate class ratings
  - Robust approach 2: ...
- Adding more degree requirements/features
  - No double-counting
  - Per-semester optimization
  - Using time data (sampling possible)
